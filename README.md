# Hiking Blog Mock-Up - Front End

This project uses HTML, CSS and vanilla JS to create a blog site with the ability to view recent posts, post new blog posts and a contact form.

The uploads are saved in local storage and can be deleted with the button on the blog page. Images are uploaded and shown via the Imgur API, and contact messages handled with the FormSubmit backend. 

Will add dynamic styling for mobile in future.
